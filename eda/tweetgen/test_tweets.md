ICML 2025 poster paper from India

This paper aims to improve code language models' ability to handle various code editing tasks. It introduces a novel synthetic data generation pipeline and a robust model adaptation algorithm, called SeleKT, to address the challenges of lacking high-quality fine-tuning data and potential loss of pre-trained abilities during adaptation.

## Teaching Transformers Causal Reasoning through Axiomatic Training

**Tweet:**
ICML 2025 poster paper

This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can learn causal reasoning by directly absorbing symbolic demonstrations of causal axioms, instead of relying on data. The authors specifically examine whether models trained on demonstrations of axioms, such as transitivity and d-separation, generalize to more complex causal scenarios.
