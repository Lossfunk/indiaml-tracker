## üìã Overview

The **IndiaML Tracker** systematically identifies, analyzes, and highlights India's contributions to global machine‚Äëlearning research. Born from a Twitter exchange between *Paras Chopra* (Lossfunk Founder) and *Sohan Basak* (hard‚Äëcore technologist, building the future of human‚ÄìAI interaction) in **January‚ÄØ2025**, the project focuses on research conducted **within Indian institutions**. By publishing transparent metrics, we aim to showcase domestic innovation and inspire the next generation of researchers.

### Why We Built This

Despite India's growing presence in top‚Äëtier ML venues, there was **no dedicated platform** quantifying that contribution. IndiaML Tracker addresses this gap by providing institution‚Äëlevel analytics grounded in openly verifiable data.

Our goals include:

- üîç Increasing visibility of Indian research institutions globally
- üìä Creating benchmarks for measuring progress in ML research output
- ü§ù Identifying collaboration opportunities between institutions
- ‚ú® Inspiring young researchers by showcasing successful Indian contributions

## üßÆ Methodology of Inclusion

> **Where does our data come from?**  
> Currently, **all paper metadata is sourced from the public‚ÄØ[OpenReview](https://openreview.net) API**. OpenReview is used by many‚Äîbut not all‚ÄîML conferences. We therefore treat it as a **significant subset, not the entirety**, of relevant literature.

1. **Inclusion criterion**: A paper is counted as ‚ÄúIndian research‚Äù when **‚â•‚ÄØ1 author is affiliated with an Indian organisation at the time of publication**.
2. **Optional filters**:
   - *First‚Äëauthor Indian*: first listed author is India‚Äëaffiliated.
   - *Majority Indian*: >‚ÄØ50‚ÄØ% of authors are India‚Äëaffiliated.
3. **Affiliation resolution**: We use deterministic rules first (institution lookup tables), followed by **LLM‚Äëassisted disambiguation** (via OpenRouter). Because LLMs are stochastic, errors can creep in‚Äî**please help us correct them!**
4. **Limitations**:
   - Conferences that do **not** publish to OpenReview are currently absent.
   - Pre‚Äëprints (e.g., arXiv) are outside our present scope.
   - LLM hallucinations or missing metadata can introduce noise.

**Found a missing or mis‚Äëclassified paper?** Create an [issue](https://github.com/lossfunk/indiaml-tracker/issues) or open a pull request‚Äîwe‚Äôll review quickly.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

IndiaML Tracker follows a **modular, pipeline‚Äëbased architecture** that enables systematic processing of research‚Äëpaper data:

![IndiaML Architecture](./indiaml-architecture.svg)

Key design patterns:

- **Adapter Pattern** ‚Äì standardises data collection from heterogeneous sources
- **Factory Pattern** ‚Äì instantiates the correct adapter from config
- **Repository Pattern** ‚Äì abstracts database operations
- **Pipeline Pattern** ‚Äì chains discrete processing stages

> **Ongoing work**: We are actively experimenting with **additional data sources** (e.g. ACL Anthology, arXiv bulk metadata) and **more robust pipelines** (e.g. deterministic disambiguation, structured affiliation ontologies) to keep improving coverage and accuracy.

For complete technical details, see [Documentation](./DOCUMENTATION.md).

## ü§ù How to Contribute

We welcome contributions! The **fastest** way to help is to **run the pipeline and submit data**‚Äîthis expands the dataset and validates existing entries.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Pipeline and Submit Data

```bash
# Clone the repository
 git clone https://github.com/lossfunk/indiaml-tracker.git
 cd indiaml-tracker

# (Recommended) set up with uv
 uv venv --python=3.12
 uv pip install .

# Alternative: standard venv
 python -m venv venv
 source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
 pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add your API keys (for LLM steps)
 echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env

# Run the pipeline step‚Äëby‚Äëstep
 python -m indiaml.pipeline.process_venue
 python -m indiaml.pipeline.process_authors
 python -m indiaml.pipeline.process_paper_author_mapping
 python -m indiaml.pipeline.patch_unk_cc2
 python -m indiaml.pipeline.patch_unk_cc3   # <-- inspect logs for unmatched affiliations
 python -m indiaml.pipeline.patch_unk_cc4
 # Optional LLM‚Äëbased PDF workflow
 python -m indiaml.pipeline.patch_unk_cc5
 # Analytics & output
 python -m indiaml.analytics.analytics
 python -m indiaml.pipeline.generate_final_jsons
 python -m indiaml.pipeline.generate_summaries
```

Then submit a **pull request** with the updated JSON files and summaries.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Verify and Correct Data

Data quality is paramount. You can help by reviewing:

- Author names / affiliations
