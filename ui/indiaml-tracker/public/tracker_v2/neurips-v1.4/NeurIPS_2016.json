      "abstract": "We demonstrate a spiking neural circuit for azimuth angle detection  inspired by the  echolocation circuits of the Horseshoe bat  Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and utilize it to devise a  model for  navigation and target tracking, capturing several key aspects of information transmission in biology. Our network,  using only  a simple local-information based sensor implementing the cardioid angular gain function, operates at biological  spike rate of  10 Hz.  The network  tracks large angular targets (60 degrees) within 1 sec with a 10%  RMS error. We study the navigational ability of our model for foraging and target localization tasks in  a forest of obstacles  and show that our network requires less than 200X   spike-triggered decisions, while suffering only a 1% loss in performance compared to a  proportional-integral-derivative controller, in the presence of 50% additive noise. Superior performance can be obtained at  a higher average spike rate of  100 Hz  and  1000 Hz, but even the accelerated networks requires 20X and 10X lesser decisions respectively, demonstrating the superior computational efficiency of bio-inspired information processing systems.",

      "normalized_status": "poster",
      "abstract": "Social media and social networking sites have become a global pinboard for exposition and discussion of news, topics, and ideas, where social media users often update their opinions about a particular topic by learning from the opinions shared by their friends. In this context, can we learn a data-driven model of opinion dynamics that is able to accurately forecast users' opinions? In this paper, we introduce SLANT, a probabilistic modeling framework of opinion dynamics, which represents users' opinions over time by means of marked jump  diffusion stochastic differential equations, and allows for efficient model simulation and parameter estimation from historical fine grained event data. We then leverage our framework to derive a set of efficient predictive formulas for opinion forecasting and identify conditions under which opinions converge to a steady state. Experiments on data gathered from Twitter show that our model provides a good fit to the data and our formulas achieve more accurate forecasting than alternatives.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we study the mixed linear regression (MLR) problem, where the goal is to recover multiple underlying linear models from their unlabeled linear measurements. We propose a non-convex objective function which we show is {\\em locally strongly convex} in the neighborhood of the ground truth. We use a tensor method for initialization so that the initial models are in the local strong convexity region. We then employ general convex optimization algorithms to minimize the objective function. To the best of our knowledge, our approach provides first exact recovery guarantees for the MLR problem with $K \\geq 2$ components. Moreover,  our method has near-optimal computational complexity $\\tilde O (Nd)$ as well as near-optimal sample complexity $\\tilde O (d)$ for {\\em constant} $K$. Furthermore, we show that our non-convex formulation can be extended to solving the {\\em subspace clustering} problem as well. In particular, when initialized within a small constant distance to the true subspaces, our method converges to the global optima (and recovers true subspaces) in time {\\em linear} in the number of points. Furthermore, our empirical results indicate that even with random initialization, our approach converges to the global optima in linear time, providing speed-up of up to two orders of magnitude.",

      "status": "Poster",
      "normalized_status": "poster",
      "abstract": "Person Re-Identification is the task of matching images of a person across multiple camera views. Almost all prior approaches address this challenge by attempting to learn the possible transformations that relate the different views of a person from a training corpora. Then, they utilize these transformation patterns for matching a query image to those in a gallery image bank at test time. This necessitates learning good feature representations of the images and having a robust feature matching technique. Deep learning approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), simultaneously do both and have shown great promise recently. In this work, we propose two CNN-based architectures for Person Re-Identification. In the first, given a pair of images, we extract feature maps from these images via multiple stages of convolution and pooling. A novel inexact matching technique then matches pixels in the first representation with those of the second. Furthermore, we search across a wider region in the second representation for matching. Our novel matching technique allows us to tackle the challenges posed by large viewpoint variations, illumination changes or partial occlusions. Our approach shows a promising performance and requires only about half the parameters as a current state-of-the-art technique. Nonetheless, it also suffers from false matches at times. In order to mitigate this issue, we propose a fused architecture that combines our inexact matching pipeline with a state-of-the-art exact matching technique. We observe substantial gains with the fused model over the current state-of-the-art on multiple challenging datasets of varying sizes, with gains of up to about 21%.",

      "status": "Poster",
      "normalized_status": "poster",
      "abstract": "Matrix completion, where we wish to recover a low rank matrix by observing a few entries from it, is a widely studied problem in both theory and practice with wide applications. Most of the provable algorithms so far on this problem have been restricted to the offline setting where they provide an estimate of the unknown matrix using all observations simultaneously. However, in many applications, the online version, where we observe one entry at a time and dynamically update our estimate, is more appealing. While existing algorithms are efficient for the offline setting, they could be highly inefficient for the online setting.  In this paper, we propose the first provable, efficient online algorithm for matrix completion. Our algorithm starts from an initial estimate of the matrix and then performs non-convex stochastic gradient descent (SGD). After every observation, it performs a fast update involving only one row of two tall matrices, giving near linear total runtime. Our algorithm can be naturally used in the offline setting as well, where it gives competitive sample complexity and runtime to state of the art algorithms. Our proofs introduce a general framework to show that SGD updates tend to stay away from saddle surfaces and could be of broader interests to other non-convex problems.",

      "abstract": "Person Re-Identification is the task of matching images of a person across multiple camera views. Almost all prior approaches address this challenge by attempting to learn the possible transformations that relate the different views of a person from a training corpora. Then, they utilize these transformation patterns for matching a query image to those in a gallery image bank at test time. This necessitates learning good feature representations of the images and having a robust feature matching technique. Deep learning approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), simultaneously do both and have shown great promise recently. In this work, we propose two CNN-based architectures for Person Re-Identification. In the first, given a pair of images, we extract feature maps from these images via multiple stages of convolution and pooling. A novel inexact matching technique then matches pixels in the first representation with those of the second. Furthermore, we search across a wider region in the second representation for matching. Our novel matching technique allows us to tackle the challenges posed by large viewpoint variations, illumination changes or partial occlusions. Our approach shows a promising performance and requires only about half the parameters as a current state-of-the-art technique. Nonetheless, it also suffers from false matches at times. In order to mitigate this issue, we propose a fused architecture that combines our inexact matching pipeline with a state-of-the-art exact matching technique. We observe substantial gains with the fused model over the current state-of-the-art on multiple challenging datasets of varying sizes, with gains of up to about 21%.",

      "abstract": "We demonstrate a spiking neural circuit for azimuth angle detection  inspired by the  echolocation circuits of the Horseshoe bat  Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and utilize it to devise a  model for  navigation and target tracking, capturing several key aspects of information transmission in biology. Our network,  using only  a simple local-information based sensor implementing the cardioid angular gain function, operates at biological  spike rate of  10 Hz.  The network  tracks large angular targets (60 degrees) within 1 sec with a 10%  RMS error. We study the navigational ability of our model for foraging and target localization tasks in  a forest of obstacles  and show that our network requires less than 200X   spike-triggered decisions, while suffering only a 1% loss in performance compared to a  proportional-integral-derivative controller, in the presence of 50% additive noise. Superior performance can be obtained at  a higher average spike rate of  100 Hz  and  1000 Hz, but even the accelerated networks requires 20X and 10X lesser decisions respectively, demonstrating the superior computational efficiency of bio-inspired information processing systems.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we study the mixed linear regression (MLR) problem, where the goal is to recover multiple underlying linear models from their unlabeled linear measurements. We propose a non-convex objective function which we show is {\\em locally strongly convex} in the neighborhood of the ground truth. We use a tensor method for initialization so that the initial models are in the local strong convexity region. We then employ general convex optimization algorithms to minimize the objective function. To the best of our knowledge, our approach provides first exact recovery guarantees for the MLR problem with $K \\geq 2$ components. Moreover,  our method has near-optimal computational complexity $\\tilde O (Nd)$ as well as near-optimal sample complexity $\\tilde O (d)$ for {\\em constant} $K$. Furthermore, we show that our non-convex formulation can be extended to solving the {\\em subspace clustering} problem as well. In particular, when initialized within a small constant distance to the true subspaces, our method converges to the global optima (and recovers true subspaces) in time {\\em linear} in the number of points. Furthermore, our empirical results indicate that even with random initialization, our approach converges to the global optima in linear time, providing speed-up of up to two orders of magnitude.",
