      "abstract": "Gaussian  Processes  are  powerful  regression  models  specified  by  parametrized mean and covariance functions.  Standard approaches  to  estimate  these  parameters  (known  by  the  name  Hyperparam(cid:173) eters)  are  Maximum  Likelihood  (ML)  and  Maximum  APosterior  (MAP)  approaches.  In this paper, we  propose and investigate pre(cid:173) dictive  approaches,  namely,  maximization  of  Geisser's  Surrogate  Predictive Probability (GPP) and minimization of mean square er(cid:173) ror with  respect to GPP  (referred to as  Geisser's  Predictive mean  square  Error  (GPE))  to  estimate  the  hyperparameters.  We  also  derive  results  for  the  standard  Cross-Validation  (CV)  error  and  make  a  comparison.  These approaches are tested on  a  number of  problems and experimental results show that these approaches are  strongly competitive to existing approaches.",
